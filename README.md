# harvester

This will eventually be a program that fetches emails from IMAP and
stashes them in a Postgres database. There are a few ideas I have
for where this will go, but this component will mostly be a long-running
process for feeding emails to the database.

Though it's named harvester, I assume in the future there will be
multiple harvesters.
